## Project

It can be difficult sometimes to talk about something when we don't feel that the person with whom we share does not understand or share the same ideas. Though it is a necessity as human to connect and belong.
Connect With provides a safe place where everyone is welcome and can share, experience and participate in the community.

Unregistered user have a read only access and if they want to participate to discussions or ask question, they will have to registered.

### Developer and Business Goals

#### Fonts

Considering the targeted audience, the sans serif type of font is the more appropriate because it is most often associated with simplicity and straightforwardness.

The website will use well known and popular font that are used online in order to bring to the user a "feeling of knowing".

* Poppins for headings.

* Lato for main content.

Sans serif will be use as a fall back if the fonts do not load. It is common as the main typographies are sans serif type.

#### Icons

* Some Font Awesome icons will be part of the website for better UX.
* The [favicon](static/images/favicon.ico) was created from [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
